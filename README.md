# About Project

This is an exercise on how angular routing works. We'll create some routes, sub-routes, and redirect routes (Let's say you navigate to a url that doesn't exist in a project, we should redirect back to the homepage or can intentionally redirect to certain routes).

## CreateRoutes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
